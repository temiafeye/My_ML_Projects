# My_ML_Projects
A repository of my machine learning projects 

This is the hello world of machine learning 

If you are a beginner in Machine Learning, specifically deep learning,
Google's tensorflow is a powerful ML library to start working with and enjoying right away. 

Note: Tensorflow Version Used here was Tensorflow 1.12, in Tensorflow 2.0 many of the commands and architecture
has changed, so if you are using Tensorflow 2.0, check out new update here at tensorflow.org
